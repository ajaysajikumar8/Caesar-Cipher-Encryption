<h1>Caesar Cipher Encryption</h1>
<hr>

<p>One of the earliest and most basic encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher. It's basically a type of substitution cypher, in which each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter at a specific location down the alphabet. A would be replaced by B, B by C, and so on with a shift of one. Julius Caesar, who used it to communicate with his officials, is said to be the inspiration for the method.</p>
